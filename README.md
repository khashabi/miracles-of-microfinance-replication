# Miracles of Microfinance — Replication

This repository contains a computational replication of  
**“The Miracle of Microfinance? Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation”**  
by Banerjee, Duflo, Glennerster, and Kinnan (2015).

The purpose of this project is to reproduce the paper’s main empirical
results using the original data and specifications, while translating
the authors’ Stata-based analysis pipeline into Python. The focus is on
reproducibility and faithful implementation rather than novel analysis.

## What This Repo Contains
- Python Jupyter notebook that replicates published tables and figures
- Stata `.dta` files containing the raw data used
- Original Stata `.do` files included for reference
- The original paper and a project write-up

---

## Data and Licensing
All datasets are from **ICPSR Study 113599** and are included unmodified
for replication and educational purposes only. Use of the data is governed
by the ICPSR Data Use Agreement (see `data/LICENSE.txt`).

The original paper and associated materials are © 2015 American Economic
Association. Python code in this repository was written for replication
purposes.

## Notes
Results closely match those reported in the original paper. Minor numerical
differences may arise due to software defaults or computational choices
(e.g., bootstrap iterations).

This work originated as an academic replication exercise and has been
cleaned and reorganized for public release.
